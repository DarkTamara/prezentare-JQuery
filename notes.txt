logic 

- when clicking next step : 
    the next function =
        checks the progress counter vs the tabs count
        sets the currentStep by adding the step and progress counter(default is 1 for step) 
        triggers the stepIndication with progress as arg
    the stepIndication function =
        checks the arg, progress, and if it's more than 0, makes the back btn visible
        else it hides the back button
        loops over the tab elements and removes the active class
        loops over the progress elements and adds the hide class 
            the looping creates the effect of active tab 

- when clicking back :
    the back function =
        checks the progress to be exactly 0
        sets the currentStep by adding the step and progress counter(default is 1 for step) 
        triggers the stepIndication with progress as arg
    the stepIndication function = SAME AS NEXT
        checks the arg, progress, and if it's more than 0, makes the back btn visible
        else it hides the back button
        loops over the tab elements and removes the active class
        loops over the progress elements and adds the hide class 
            the looping creates the effect of active tab

- on step 2, when toggeling the monthly or yearly switch
    toggle functionality =
        adds or removes the class by using toggle 
    subscription functionality = 
        userPlanPrice functionlity =
            called with no arg
            checks if the plan value is monthly
            sets many values
            else it sets the values for yearly 

        totalAddons functionality = 
            called with no arg
            checks if the plan value is monthly
            else it sets the values for yearly 
            decides the selected adons and gets them based on selected checkboxes
